        There was a ginger cat who, despite all odds, was serving as a gunner on a spaceship headed to Mars. An
        alien is on the horizon, but the gunner knows what needs to be done. And so he put down his guns, for there

        confused - so much so that it is still and unmoving. As confused as the enemy is the narrator and everyone
        else is even more confused.
