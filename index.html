                There was a ginger cat who, despite all odds, was serving as a gunner on a spaceship headed to Mars. An
                alien is on the horizon, but the gunner knows what needs to be done. And so he put down his guns, for
                there was

                from
                Fallout New Vegas, pointing it at their "friend". "Bazinga," they say, gun in hand. The enemy is utterly
                confused - so much so that it is still and unmoving. As confused as the enemy is, the narrator and
