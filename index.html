            There was a ginger cat who, despite all odds, was serving as a gunner on a spaceship headed to Mars. An
            alien is
            on the horizon, but the gunner knows what needs to be done. And so he put down his guns, for there was
            nothing
            he could say.

            He then meowed so loudly the neighbours woke up. The neighbour shot a bolt of supercharged plasma at him,
            which
            was nimbly dodged."Darn, that was really close," the neighbour says, disappointed at the missed shot. Until
            it
            hits a wall behind it causing it to topple over.

            He cried for his dogs friend to help him up. But they pull out a gun, uttering the iconic opening line from
            Fallout New Vegas, pointing it as their "friend". "Bazinga", they say, gun in hand. The enemmy is utterly
            confused - so much so that it is still and unmoving. As confused as the enemy is the narrator and everyone
            else
            is even more confused.
